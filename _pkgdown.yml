- title: Adding geological timescales to plots
  desc: >
    The original purpose of deeptime, `coord_geo()` adds a highly
    customizable timescale to any `{ggplot2}` plot. Other functions now supplement
    it to aid in the visualization of data over long time scales.
  contents:
  - coord_geo
  - scale_color_geo
  - get_scale_data

- subtitle: Built-in interval data
  desc: >
    deeptime includes a selection of built-in interval data from the
    most up-to-date Geological Time Scale. These dataframes include name,
    max age, min age, abbreviation, and color columns.
  contents:
  - eons
  - eras
  - periods
  - epochs
  - stages

- subtitle: Deprecated functions
  desc: >
    The following functions represent the first and second iterations of what is
    now `coord_geo()`. These functions still work but are considered
    "deprecated". There is no plan to remove them in the immediate future (for
    those who used them or still use them in their code), but there is no
    guarantee they will be supported ad infinitum. Users are strongly encouraged
    to use `coord_geo()` instead, which has more features and is still under
    active development.

- title: Adding geological timescales to phylogenies
  desc: >
    These functions can be used to add timescales specifically to phylogenies
    that are plotted with [ggtree](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/ggtree).

  - coord_geo
  - coord_geo_polar
  - scale_color_geo

- title: Plotting trait data
  desc: >
    These functions can be used for visualizing species trait data.

  - geom_phylomorpho
  - disparity_through_time
  - panel.disparity
  - coord_trans_xy

- title: Combining and arranging plots
  desc: >
    These functions can be used to combine and arrange plots into
    publishable-quality figures.
  contents:
  - ggarrange2
  - gtable_frame2

- title: Transforming coordinate systems
  desc: >
    These functions can be used to modify the way that your data is plotted
    by `{ggplot2}`.
